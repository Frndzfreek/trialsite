          <p>
            I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Tech University with a passion for creating elegant solutions
            to complex problems. My journey in programming started in high school when I built my first website, and
            I've been hooked ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in full-stack web development with expertise in React, Next.js, Node.js, and modern cloud
            technologies. I'm particularly interested in AI/ML applications and how they can be integrated into web
            experiences to create more intelligent and responsive applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, participating in hackathons, or
            exploring new technologies. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push my skills
            further.
